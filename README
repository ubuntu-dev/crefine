>>>>> This is README for C-Refine Version 2.4 <<<<<

C-Refine is a preprocessor for programs written in C or C++ or a similar 
language. It introduces an additional language construct called 'refinement'
which allows further decomposition with symbolic names inside functions.
This makes programs much easier to read and modify and is very comfortable
for programming.

The system consists of a single executable file (crefine) and one
Unix Manualpage (crefine.1). No further data files or libraries 
except the standard C library are needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To generate C-Refine (which is bootstrapped, i.e. written in C-Refine)
you must first compile the preprocessed version of the files.

This is done with the command
  make crefine_from_c
which always compiles and links all 4 parts.

If you have a working version of C-Refine you can bootstrap it via
  make crefine

The makefile also mentions a rule for translating in one step from
C-Refine to .o

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have gotten C-Refine to work on a machine not mentioned below,
please send me (prechelt@ira.uka.de) a short note of the form:

   Subject: got C-Refine working
   I got C-Refine 2.4 to work without problems on the following machine
   <name-of-computer> <name-and-version-of-operating-system>
   
(...or describe why C-Refine didn't compile and perhaps send me a minimal
diff to get it to work.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environments where C-Refine already works:

(CF is the certainty factor with the following meaning:
 1: compiles  (I have checked that)
 2: most probably compiles (but I don't have machine at hand to check again)
 3: probably compiles (it once did, but changes may have reversed this)
 4: should compile (have done my best from what I know about that system)
 5: may compile (a bit doubtful)
)
 
CF  Machine            Operating System (and perhaps Compiler)

1   DECstation 3100    Ultrix 4.1
3   IBM PC etc.        MS-DOS 3.2 (Microsoft C 5.0)
3   PCS (type???)      (some System V)
2   Sun3               SUN-OS 3.5
1   Sun3,Sun4          SUN-OS 4.03
1   Sun3,Sun4          SUN-OS 4.1
1   VAXstation 3250    Ultrix-32 V3.1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Makefile will not work with some prehistoric versions of "make".
In this case I strongly suggest that you get a newer make, e.g. GNU-Make.

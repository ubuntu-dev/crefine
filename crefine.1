.SH DESCRIPTION
.B crefine (C-Refine)
(spoken like 'see refine') is a preprocessor that adds a new language
construct to C and C++: the 
.I refinement.
crefine massages a source code file to produce plain C output from
C input with refinements or plain C++ from C++ with refinements.
The syntax of refinements is described in the USAGE section.
Only a single source file may be processed with one call; the name of the
output file, if not given, is derived from the name of the input file
by removing its last 
character, if that is an 
.B r
(which is the filename convention for C\-Refine).
If the last character of
the input filename is not an 
.B r
, the output filename is derived from it
by appending
.B RRR
instead.
Input and output is always to and from named
files. Error messages go to the standard output. The startup message,
if not suppressed, goes to standard error.

C\-Refine does not act in any way upon the directives for the
C preprocessor. This especially means that include files have to be 
processed separately. Usually, this will not be necessary, since they do
not typically contain anything that C\-Refine should work on.
A second consequence is, that it is possible for C\-Refine to give error
messages on correct programs, because it does not see the effects of 
running the preprocessor. In these cases you either have to change your 
source code or run the C preprocessor before C\-Refine.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
anyway. Normally, if any error was detected by C\-Refine, the output file 
will automatically be deleted. This option says not to do so.
.TP
.B \-c
comment refinement names in the output. Any inserted 
refiement body in the output is titled by a comment giving the refinement
name and the refinement nesting level.
.TP
.B \-f
feedback that you work. For the homo ludens in the programmer or people
with incredibly overloaded machines. Shows running line numbers on standard
error.
.TP
.B \-i
indent the 
.I #line
directives in the resulting output to the appropriate
indentation level as indicated by the nesting of refinements. Not an 
especially important option, but since this is a true UNIX program, it is
present anyway.
.TP
.B \-l
list all refinement names.
The names of all processed refinements are listed
to the standard output along with their line numbers. 
I do not know exactly what this option may be good
for, but I believe someday somebody will need it.
.TP
.B \-m<ch>
message language. Originally, C\-Refine was written by a typical german
programmer in the typical german programmer schizophrenia situation: 
as a german the native tongue is german,
as a programmer the native tongue is
english. So both languages were supported for the error messages.
Even worse, since I believe the whole data processing world is much too
serious, I liked to have a humourous version either. So now any of the 
characters 
.B d,D,g,G
immediately after the option character m gives you
german error and warning messages, 
.B e
or
.B E
gives english ones (which, 
for sake of internationality, is the default) and every other letter lets
you stick to (german) humor.
.TP
.B \-n<num>
numbering with
.I #line
commands. By default, every insertion of a
refinement body is accompanied by a #line preprocessor directive in the 
output. This is the default numbering level 3.
By giving a smaller number just after the option character
.B n
, the amount of
.I #line
directives used can be 
reduced (level 2 or 1) or set to zero (level 0). What is best depends on 
the behavior of your local C or C++ compiler.
Just try it out, beginning with the default level 3.
.TP
.B \-p
plus. The C++ mode. The only difference between C mode and C++ mode for
C\-Refine is, that in C++ mode the C++ doubleslash comment convention is
obeyed, while in C mode it is not. This is possible because C\-Refine knows
very little about the actual syntax of these two languages.
So in most cases, this difference makes no difference at all.
.TP
.B \-q
quiet mode. Suppresses the startup message of C\-Refine.
.TP
.B \-r<ch>
refinement symbol. Select what character shall be recognized as the 
refinement symbol in the input file. The character to chose must be given
on the command line immediately after the option character
.B r.
This is the
backquote (ASCII code 95) by default. Since there are only two printable
ASCII characters that are unused in the syntax of C (the backquote, 
code 96, and the dollar or currency sign, code 36) there is very little 
choice on a machine with 7 bit character set. This choice is further 
restricted because on some systems (such as VMS) the dollar sign is
acutally being allowed and used for identifiers.
Some more possiblilities arise when having an 8 bit character set, such
as the IBM international character set (proposed symbol there is the
little double right angle bracket, code 175, which really looks nice),
but take into account that any change in refinement symbol is bad
for the portability of your source files.
.TP
.B \-R<num>
refinement symbol. Same as before, but the new symbol is given by its
character code instead of by itself.
.TP
.B \-s
strip. Produces smaller output by stripping of all indentation, whether
present in the input or generated by C\-Refine, and all comments.
This is on by default. To switch it off, use the syntax 
.B \-s\-
.TP
.B \-w<num>
warning level. C\-Refine is able to give various warnings about your
source code. These can be suppressed in three stages. The default warning
level is 3 (all warnings). You can chose any level from 0 (no warnings)
to 3 by giving the appropriate number right after the option character
.B w
on the command line.
.TP
.B \-B<num>
buffer. Select the size of the source code buffer
in which C\-Refine holds the
code for a function while processing it. The default is 150000 bytes.
.TP
.B \-E<num>
errors. Select the maximum number of errors that may occur in the input
before C\-Refine stops processing prematurely. The default is 20.
.TP
.B \-L<num>
lines. Select the maximum number of source code lines per single function
that C\-Refine is able to hold. The default is 2500. 
.TP
.B \-N<num>
number of refinements per function.
Selects the maximum number of refinement
declarations that may be present within any single function. 
The default is 200.
.TP
.B \-T<num>
tab size. Select the number of spaces to which a TAB character expands.
C\-Refine expands all TAB characters at the beginning of a line, i.e. those
that act as indentation. Other TABs are left untouched. The default is 1.
.TP
.B \-W<num>
warnings. Select the maximum number of warnings that may occur
before C\-Refine stops processing prematurely. The default is 30.
.SH USAGE
There are three new syntactic elements with C\-Refine:
the refinement definition, the refinement call and the leave construct.
The purpose of refinements is to support
the Top\-Down style of programming
(a) within a function and (b) in both, thinking and writing.
Essentially, refinements are just parameterless macros with
long descriptive names.
Refinements are in any case local to a function. They may be called 
before they are declared; declaration and definition of a 
refinement are one.
The syntax of refinements as defined by C\-Refine is
.I not
format free, but lays significance upon whether a special symbol (the
refinement symbol) is occuring in column 0 or somewhere else.

Along with the new language constructs are some layout restrictions
for the program text being defined. This is necessary, because (a) the
syntax of the refinement constructs breaks basic syntactic rules of C and
(b) the C\-Refine preprocessor relies on some simple formatting rules, so
its algorithms can be kept simple and the whole thing small, portable,
robust, reliable and fast.

Here are the (very informal) descriptions of the syntax and semantics of
the language elements introduced by C\-Refine:
.TP
refinement names
A 
.I refinement name
is just a normal C identifier, with one important addition:
blanks are allowed within (!)
it (i.e. anywhere after the first nonblank character
of the name and before the last nonblank one); they are equivalent to
underscores. The end of a refinement name is always detected by the
appearence of a special symbol, typically a semicolon, a colon or an
operator.
A refinement name must, however, be on a single line.
.TP
.B refinement calls
A
.I refinement call
consists of the refinement symbol, immediately followed
by a refinement name. The refinement symbol must not be in colums 0 of the
source line. Refinement calls are principally allowed anywhere within 
a function. The called refinement must be defined in that function, although
the definition may (and usually will) appear later than the call.
The semantics of a refinement call is as follows:
A 
.I procedural refinement
(i.e. one that contains at least one semicolon in
its body) is inserted instead of its call, surrounded by a pair of curly 
braces. This insertion is recursively applied to nested refinements.
A 
.I valued refinement
(i.e. one that contains just an expression and no 
semicolon in its body) is inserted instead of its call, surrounded by 
a pair of parentheses.
This insertion is recursively applied to nested valued refinements.
So procedural refinements can be called anywhere where a block statement is
legal. Valued refinements can be called anywhere where a parenthesed 
expression is legal.
An illegal form of refinement call will be detected by C\-Refine.
.TP
.B refinement definitions
a refinement definition consists of the refinement symbol, immediately 
followed by a refinement name, followed by a colon. 
The refinement symbol must be in column 0 of the
source line. Refinement definitions are allowed only on block nesting
level 1, i.e. in the outermost block of a function.
The body of a refinement is examined to decide what type of
refinement it is:
All refinements that contain one or more semicolons in their body,
that are not part of a comment, character denoter or string denoter, 
are called
.I procedural refinements,
since they contain statements.
All other refinements are called
.I valued refinements,
since they only contain an expression and thus return a value.
Illegal syntax of a refinement declaration and the declaration of 
refinements that are never used will be detected by C\-Refine.
.TP
.B leave
The 
.I leave construct
may be used from within any procedural refinement at any place where a 
statement is legal. It consists of the keyword
.B leave
followed by the refinement symbol, followed by a refinement name
.I ref.
The semantics of this construct is, that a 
.I goto
statement is inserted instead of the leave construct, that jumps to
a point right after the last statement of the refinement 
.I ref.
For this to be legal
.I ref
must be present in the current static nesting of refinement calls.
This means that not only the current refinement can be left with 
.I leave,
but any number of refinements that are statically nested at that point
of your code. Illegal use of the leave construct is detected by C\-Refine.

As by now, I assume, almost any understanding that may initially have been
there, will probably have vanished. I will try to get it back to you by 
means of the following example. This is a (very simple\-minded) version
of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. It should not be thought that I believe the
refinement technique to be especially well suited to this problem, but this
was the smallest 'real' problem I could think of to demonstrate at least
most of what the possibilities of C\-Refine are. So here it is:

.nf
#define MAX        10000
#define PRIME      0
#define NON_PRIME  1

static int sieve[MAX+1];

int main ()
{
  `initialize;
  `do sieve;
  `make output;
  return (0);
  
`initialize:
  int current;
  for (current = 2; current <= MAX; current++)
    sieve[current] = PRIME;
    
`do sieve:
  int current_prime = 1;
  for (;;) {
    `find next bigger prime;  /* perhaps STOP here */
    `delete all multiples of current_prime;
  }

`find next bigger prime:
  int current_candidate = current_prime + 1;
  while (sieve[current_candidate] == NON_PRIME)
    if (current_candidate == MAX)
      leave `do sieve;    /* leave two refinements at once */
    else
      current_candidate++;
  /* now current_candidate is a prime (or we leave `sieve) */
  current_prime = current_candidate;
  
`delete all multiples of current_prime:
  int current = `first multiple of current_prime;
  while (current <= MAX) {
    sieve[current] = NON_PRIME;
    current += current_prime;
  }
  
`first multiple of current_prime:
  2 * current_prime

`make output:
  int current;  /* different from 'current' above */
  printf ("The primes between 2 and %d are\n", MAX);
  for (current = 2; current <= MAX; current++)
    if (`current is prime)
      printf ("%5d ", current);

`current is prime:
  sieve[current] == PRIME

} /* end of main() */

/***** End of example *****/
.fi
To make the self documentation aspect of C\-Refine more clear, look at
the following example: A function that tests, whether its parameters
form a pythagorean triple:
.nf
bool pythagorean (double x, double y, double z)
{
  return (`all legs positive && `one is hypotenuse)
  
`all legs positive:
   x > 0  &&  y > 0  &&  z > 0

`one is hypotenuse:
  `x is hypotenuse || `y is hypotenuse || `z is hypotenuse
  
`x is hypotenuse:
  x*x == y*y + z*z 

`y is hypotenuse:
  y*y == x*x + z*z

`z is hypotenuse:
  z*z == x*x + y*y
  
}
.fi
This is good style: you write down just what you want to express and
with an optimizing compiler such code will also be perfectly efficient.
Try to imagine what this would have looked like, if it had all been 
in a single parenthesesed expression.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The warnings and error messages are intended to be self explanatory. If you
do not understand one of them anyway: chose a different language for
the messages (see option \-m), get yourself a dictionary or interpreter and
try again.

.SH BUGS
Since preprocessor directives are not handled by C\-Refine, strange things 
can happen if you use #ifdef or #if. This is especially the case, if you
use these directives to put large comments into your source files: if there
are any comments or string literals (double quotes) or char 
literals (single quotes) beginning in that area that are not properly 
closed within it, C\-Refine will run to nirvana searching for their end and 
give you lots of wrong error and warning messages.
Watch out for apostrophes (e.g. in "don't") especially!
.LP
C\-Refine should be able to act according to #line commands, so that 
the above problems could be avoided by running the preprocessor first.
.LP
Those people, who use such stupid macros as
.nf
   #define BEGIN {
   #define END   }
.fi
or similar craizy stuff, will have to change their habits in order
to use C\-Refine.
.LP
The output of C\-Refine may be code that exceeds certain compiler limits of
your C or C++ compiler. Since the body of every procedural refinement is
enclosed in a block and the body of every value returning refinement is
enclosed in parentheses, the block nexting limits or expression complexity 
limits of your compiler may be reached when you make very heavy use of
nested refinements.
.LP
Some compilers may handle the #line directive improperly, yielding wrongly
tagged error messages.
.LP
Probably C\-Refine will also work with Objective\-C,
but I am not absolutely sure about that.
.LP
There should be a mode to use C\-Refine for Lisp also.
.LP
C\-Refine reacts poor on some types of syntactic errors.
.LP
It should optionally be possible to let C\-Refine run the 
C preprocessor and react correctly to 
.I #line
directives.
.LP
In C++, when a "leave" has to jump across a variable initialization, some 
Compilers will complain, that the goto is illegal. This is not true, 
because the goto jumps to (or even beyond) the very end of the block 
where that variable is in
[precisely: the jump is to an empty statement, which is the last statement
in the block], but these compilers do not recognize that fact.
.SH VERSION
This is for C\-Refine Version 2.4
.LP
It is likely that the command syntax be changed in the next version in the
following way: multiple filenames can be given, all of which 
.I must
end with an 'r'. The output filename is constructed implicitly by 
removing that 'r' from the inputfilename. So you better do not use output
file names in your makefiles.

    Things to do to C-Refine
   ==========================

-- Lutz Prechelt, 08.05.92
   Improve ccr to allow direct option passing to crefine.
   Be careful not to get dependent on which options the C compiler
   recognizes.

-- Lutz Prechelt, 08.05.92
   Improve ccr to allow calling the preprocessor before running crefine.

-- Lutz Prechelt, 08.05.92
   Write a manpage for ccr.

-- Lutz Prechelt, 08.05.92
   Write an Emacs editing mode 'C-Refine mode', based on 'C mode'.

-- Lutz Prechelt, 08.05.92
   Extend the idea to other languages, e.g. Lisp, Scheme, Eiffel, Sather
   It is difficult to do it as simple as C-Refine now is for a language
   that does not have something equivalent to #line (except if the 
   language is interpretive instead of compiled).

-- Lutz Prechelt, 08.05.92
   Use GNU-style option processing.

-- Lutz Prechelt, 12.06.92
   Write a concept paper, explaining more deeply how C-Refine works and
   why and what it is good for.

-- Lutz Prechelt, 12.06.92
   Make all buffers fully dynamic (autoexpanding) to avoid the need
   for the options selecting their size.

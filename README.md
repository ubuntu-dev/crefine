# Refinement preprocessor by Lutz Prechelt from comp.sources (1992)

C-Refine is a preprocessor for programs written in C or C++ or a
similar language. It introduces an additional language construct
called 'refinement' which allows further decomposition with symbolic
names inside functions.  This makes programs much easier to read and
modify and is very comfortable for programming.

See the [README](README) or the paper [Prechelt92.pdf](doc/Prechelt92.pdf) 
for compilation instructions and further details, [INSTALL](INSTALL) for
installation hints.
